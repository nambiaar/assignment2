Problem Statement is below:

BASIC CODING EXERCISE
=======================

Using JQUERY and JQUERY UI provide a standalone javascript application that has a single form.

Put the files in a folder named sample web app.

On the single form there are 3 FIELDS on top, 2 BUTTONS below the fields centered with labels ADD and CLEAR and below the buttons a scrollable GRID - not HTML table.

You can use any GRID widget you want, but recommend using a JQUERY based widget.

FIELD1 is a text field (required), FIELD2 is a date picker field (not required), FIELD3 is a combo box (required)

Hardcode a JSON object to populate data in the comb box, you can use colors like YELLOW, RED, GREEN, BLACK, WHITE, ORANGE.

The GRID has 3 columns that represent the fields listed above.

When the ADD button is pressed then the data entered in the fields is added to a JSON object that is bound to the GRID.

If the user presses the ADD button 10 times there will be 10 rows in the GRID.

When the CLEAR button is pressed then GRID datasource is cleared out.

If a user selects a row in the GRID then that row should be highlighted and the data from that row will be populated into the fields on top of the form.
